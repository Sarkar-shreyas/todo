This is a basic todo list program I'm building while learning how to do things with python

V0 Created skeleton files main.py and todo.py while learning git

V1.0 Renamed main -> todo_app, deleted todo. Added baseline functionality.

V1.01 Added more comments for readability

V1.1 Remade program into a simple CLI app that logs tasks into a .json file. 

V1.11 Added a 'clear all' option
